# Twitter Sentiment Analysis using Naive Bayes

Welcome to the Twitter Sentiment Analysis project repository! This project focuses on analyzing sentiments expressed in tweets using the Naive Bayes classifier.

## Overview

Twitter Sentiment Analysis is the process of determining the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) associated with a given tweet. In this project, we use the Naive Bayes classifier, a probabilistic machine learning algorithm, to classify tweets into different sentiment categories.

## Technologies Used

### Python
Python is the primary programming language used for developing the sentiment analysis model. We utilize various Python libraries for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including text preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training.

### NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
NLTK is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data. It provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical resources, such as WordNet, along with a suite of text processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning.

### Scikit-learn
Scikit-learn is a popular machine learning library in Python. It provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis, including classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and model evaluation.

## Features

- **Tweet Collection**: Retrieve tweets from Twitter using the Twitter API or pre-collected datasets.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess tweet text by removing noise, stopwords, and special characters.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extract relevant features from tweet text, such as word frequencies or TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectors.
- **Model Training**: Train a Naive Bayes classifier using labeled tweet data.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments based on the trained model.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the sentiment analysis model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Getting Started

To run the Twitter Sentiment Analysis project and analyze sentiments in tweets, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/twitter-sentiment-analysis.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Configure your Twitter API credentials if collecting tweets from Twitter's API.
4. Run the main script to perform sentiment analysis on tweets:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community to improve and enhance the Twitter Sentiment Analysis project. Whether you're a data scientist, machine learning enthusiast, or NLP expert, there are many ways you can contribute:

- **Enhancing Model Accuracy**: Experiment with different feature extraction techniques, model architectures, or hyperparameters to improve the accuracy of sentiment classification.
- **Adding New Features**: Implement additional features such as emoji sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or topic modeling to enhance the richness of tweet analysis.
- **Optimizing Performance**: Optimize the performance and efficiency of the sentiment analysis pipeline, especially for large-scale tweet datasets.
- **Documentation**: Improve the documentation to make it more comprehensive and user-friendly.
- **Bug Fixes**: Identify and fix any bugs or issues in the codebase.
